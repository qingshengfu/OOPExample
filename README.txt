To run the program:

1. in Eclipse, import the project, find class 'App', and run 'main()' as java application

2. Or in console, 'cd' to  project directory, run './gradlew build', then run 'java -jar ./build/libs/OOPExample.jar'

3. Or using gradle directly, run 'gradle run -q'  -- the gradle screen has some noises there

To input commands, separate them with 'space', for example ' HOT 8 6 4 2 1 7 '
